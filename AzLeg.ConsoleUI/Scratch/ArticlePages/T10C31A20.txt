<p>A. If the time and place of a directors' meeting is fixed by the bylaws or the board of directors, the meeting is a regular meeting. All other meetings are special meetings.</p>

<p>B. A board of directors may hold regular or special meetings in or out of this state.</p>

<p>C. Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, the board of directors may permit any or all directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by or conduct the meeting through the use of any means of communication by which all directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. A director participating in a meeting by this means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting. </p>
