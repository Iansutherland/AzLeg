<p>A. If authorized by the articles of incorporation, members may adopt or amend a bylaw that fixes a greater quorum or voting requirement for members, or of classes of members, than is required by chapters 24 through 40 of this title. The adoption or amendment of a bylaw that adds, changes or deletes a greater quorum or voting requirement for members shall meet the same quorum requirement and shall be adopted by the same vote and classes of members required to take action under the quorum and voting requirement then in effect or proposed to be adopted, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>B. A bylaw that fixes a greater quorum or voting requirement for members under subsection A shall not be adopted, amended or repealed by the board of directors. </p>
