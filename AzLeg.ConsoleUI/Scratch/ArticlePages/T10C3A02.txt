<p>2. Have a corporate seal, which may be altered at will, and to use it, or a facsimile of it, by impressing or affixing it or in any other manner reproducing it.</p>

<p>3. Make and amend bylaws, not inconsistent with its articles of incorporation or with the laws of this state, for managing the business and regulating the affairs of the corporation.</p>

<p>5. Sell, convey, mortgage, pledge, lease, exchange and otherwise dispose of all or any part of its property.</p>

<p>6. Purchase, receive, subscribe for or otherwise acquire, own, hold, vote, use, sell, mortgage, lend, pledge or otherwise dispose of and deal&nbsp;with shares or other interests in or obligations of any other entity.</p>

<p>7. Make contracts and guarantees, incur liabilities, borrow monies, issue its notes, bonds and other obligations, which may be convertible into or include the option to purchase other securities of the corporation, and secure any of its obligations by mortgage, deed of trust, security agreement, pledge or other encumbrance of any of its property, franchises or income.</p>

<p>8. Issue any bond, debenture or debt security of the corporation by causing one or more officers designated in the bylaws or by the board of directors to sign the bond, debenture or debt security either manually or in facsimile and, if deemed necessary or appropriate by the officers, by causing its authentication, countersignature or registration, either manually or in facsimile, by a trustee, transfer agent or registrar other than the corporation itself or an employee of the corporation. If an officer who has signed, either manually or in facsimile, a bond, debenture or debt security as provided in this paragraph ceases for any reason to be an officer before the security is issued, the corporation may issue the security with the same effect as if the officer were still in office at the date of issue.</p>
