The ballot shall state &quot;Shall new counties be established from existing __________ (county or counties) as prescribed in the report of the county formation commission, including the establishment of a distribution board to estimate taxes to be levied for the distribution of county assets, liabilities and records?&quot; followed by spaces designated &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; in which the voter may indicate his vote for or against the proposition.Â  Except as otherwise provided and as far as practicable, the secretary of state shall conduct the election and canvass the returns in the same manner as general elections. If there is only one affected county and as is otherwise practicable, the secretary of state may delegate election responsibilities under this section as he deems appropriate to the board of supervisors.</p>
