<p>A. A director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the board of directors, its presiding officer or the corporation.</p>

<p>B. A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date or event. If a resignation is made effective at a later date, the board may fill the pending vacancy before the effective date if the board provides that the successor does not take office until the effective date. </p>
