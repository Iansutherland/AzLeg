<p>A. An officer may resign at any time by delivering notice to the corporation. A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date or event. If a resignation is made effective at a later date or event and the corporation accepts the later effective date, its board of directors may fill the pending vacancy before the effective date if the board of directors provides that the successor does not take office until the effective date.</p>

<p>B. A board of directors may remove any officer at any time with or without cause. </p>
