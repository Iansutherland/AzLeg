<p><font color=GREEN>10-831.</font> <font color=PURPLE><u>Standards of liability for directors; presumption</u></font></p>

<p>A director is not liable for any action taken as a director or any failure to take any action if the director's duties were performed in compliance with section 10-830. In any proceeding commenced under this chapter, a director has all of the defenses and presumptions ordinarily available to a director.  A director is presumed in all cases to have acted, failed to act or otherwise discharged the director's duties pursuant to section 10-830.  The burden is on the party challenging a director's action, failure to act or other discharge of duties to establish by clear and convincing evidence facts rebutting the presumption. </p>
