<p>A. The articles of incorporation of any corporation may include a provision granting to any investor or investors an option to have the corporation dissolved at will or upon the performance or occurrence of any specified event or contingency. Whenever any such option to dissolve is exercised, the investor or investors exercising such option shall give written notice thereof to all other investors. After the expiration of thirty days following the mailing of such notice, the dissolution of the corporation shall proceed as if the required vote power had consented to the dissolution of the corporation as provided by section 10-1402.</p>

<p>B. If the articles of incorporation as originally filed do not contain a provision authorized by subsection A of this section, the articles of incorporation may be amended to include such provision if adopted by the affirmative vote of all investors. If the articles of incorporation as originally filed contain a provision authorized by subsection A of this section, such provision may be amended only by the affirmative vote of all investors.</p>

<p>C. Sections 10-1401, 10-1402 and 10-1801 shall be applicable to voluntary dissolution notwithstanding the reference in subsection A of this section to section 10-1402. </p>
