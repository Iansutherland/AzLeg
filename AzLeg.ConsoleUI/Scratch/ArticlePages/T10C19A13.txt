<p>A. A member may bring charges against an officer or director by filing them in writing with the secretary of the association, together with a petition for removal signed by ten per cent of the members. The removal shall be voted upon at the next regular or special meeting and the association may remove the officer or director by a majority vote of the members. The director or officer shall be informed in writing of the charges previous to the meeting, and he and the person bringing the charges may be heard in person or by counsel and may call witnesses at the meeting.</p>

<p>B. If the by-laws provide for election of directors by districts with primary elections in each district, then the petition for removal of a director shall be signed by twenty per cent of the members residing in the district from which he was elected. The board shall call a special meeting of the members residing in that district to consider the removal of the director, and he may be removed by a vote of the majority of the members of that district. </p>
