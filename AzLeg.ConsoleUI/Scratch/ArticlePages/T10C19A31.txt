<p>The officers of a generation and transmission cooperative consist of a president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer, who are elected annually by and from the board of directors. If stated in the bylaws, the officers of the cooperative do not need to be members of the board of directors. Unless the bylaws provide otherwise, if a person holding any office ceases to be a director, the person ceases to hold the office. The offices of secretary and treasurer may be held by the same person. The board of directors may also elect or appoint such other officers, agents or employees it deems necessary or advisable and shall prescribe their powers and duties. An officer may be removed from office and the officer's successor may be elected in the manner prescribed in the bylaws. </p>
