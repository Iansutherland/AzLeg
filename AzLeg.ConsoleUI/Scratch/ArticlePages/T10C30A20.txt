<p>A. After fixing a record date for a meeting, a corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all of its members who are entitled to notice of the meeting. The list shall show the address and number of votes each member is entitled to vote at the meeting. The corporation shall prepare on a current basis through the time of the membership meeting another list of members, if any, who are entitled to vote at the meeting, but not entitled to notice of the meeting and the corporation shall prepare that list on the same basis and make it a part of the list of members.</p>

<p>B. For the purpose of communication with other members concerning the meeting the corporation shall make the list of members available for inspection by any member at the corporation's principal office or at another place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. On written demand a member, a member's agent or a member's attorney may inspect and, subject to the limitations of section 10-11602, subsection C, and section 10-11605, may copy the list, during regular business hours and at the member's expense, during the period it is available for inspection.</p>

<p>C. The corporation shall make the list of members available at the meeting, and any member, a member's agent or a member's attorney may inspect the list at any time during the meeting or during any adjournment.</p>

<p>D. If the corporation refuses to allow a member, a member's agent or a member's attorney to inspect the list of members before or at the meeting or copy the list as permitted by subsection B of this section, the court in the county where a corporation's principal office is located, or if no principal office is located in this state, the court in the county where a corporation's known place of business is located, on application of the member, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the corporation's expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete.</p>

<p>E. Refusal or failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting.</p>

<p>F. The articles of incorporation or bylaws of a corporation organized primarily for religious purposes may limit or abolish the rights of a member under this section to inspect and copy any corporate record. </p>
