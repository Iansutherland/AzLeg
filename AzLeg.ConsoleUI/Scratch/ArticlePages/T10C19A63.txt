<p><font color=GREEN>10-2063</font>. <font color=PURPLE><u>Waiver of notice of meeting</u></font></p>

<p>A person entitled to notice of a meeting may waive notice in writing either before or after the meeting. If the person attends the meeting, his attendance constitutes a waiver of notice of the meeting, unless he participates therein solely to object to the transaction of any business because the meeting has not been legally called or convened. </p>
