<p>A. A corporation may pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition of the proceeding if both of the following conditions exist:</p>

<p>1. The director furnishes the corporation with a written affirmation of the director's good faith belief that the director has met the standard of conduct described in section 10-851 or that the proceeding involves conduct for which liability has been eliminated under a provision of the articles of incorporation pursuant to section 10-202, subsection B, paragraph&nbsp;1. </p>

<p>2. The director furnishes the corporation with a written undertaking, executed personally or on the director's behalf, to repay the advance if the director is not entitled to mandatory indemnification under section 10-852 and it is ultimately determined under section 10-854 or 10-855 that the director did not meet the standard of conduct.</p>

<p>B. The undertaking required by subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section is an unlimited general obligation of the director but need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.</p>

<p>C.  Authorizations of payments under this section shall be made in a manner consistent with section 10-830 or 10-842.</p>

<p>D. This section does not apply to advancement of expenses to or for the benefit of an outside director. Advances to outside directors shall be made pursuant to section 10-852. </p>
