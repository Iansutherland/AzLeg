<p>If a corporation indemnifies or advances expenses to a director under sections 10-3851 through 10-3854, the corporation shall report the indemnification or advance in writing to the members with or before the notice of the next meeting of members. Failure to report under this section does not invalidate otherwise valid indemnification. </p>
