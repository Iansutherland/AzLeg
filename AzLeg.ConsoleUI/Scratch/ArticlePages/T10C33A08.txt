A corporation's articles may be amended pursuant to this section without action by the board of directors or members or approval required pursuant to section 10-11030 to carry out a plan of reorganization ordered or decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction under a federal statute or a statute of this state if the articles of incorporation after amendment contain only provisions required or permitted by section 10-3202.</p>

<p>5. A statement that the court had jurisdiction of the proceeding under federal or state statute.</p>

<p>C. This section does not apply after entry of a final decree in the reorganization proceeding even though the court retains jurisdiction of the proceeding for limited purposes unrelated to consummation of the reorganization plan.</p>
