<p>A. No creditor of the corporation may bring a proceeding to reach the liability of a member to the corporation unless final judgment has been rendered in favor of the creditor against the corporation, and execution has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part.</p>

<p>B. All creditors of the corporation, with or without reducing their claims to judgment, may intervene in any creditor's proceeding brought under subsection A to reach and apply unpaid amounts due the corporation. Any or all members who owe amounts to the corporation may be joined in that proceeding.</p>

<p>C. In any proceeding by a creditor under this section, the member shall pay any amount that is determined to be owed by the member to the corporation directly to the corporation and not to any creditor. The member is not liable directly or indirectly for any costs incurred by the creditor in the proceeding. If the member has paid the amount to the corporation, the liability of the member to the corporation for that amount is fully satisfied, the member is no longer a party to the proceeding and is immune from further proceedings under this section for the amount. </p>
