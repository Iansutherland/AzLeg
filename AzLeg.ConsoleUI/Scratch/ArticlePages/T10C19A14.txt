<p>The by-laws shall provide for one or more regular meetings annually. The board of directors may call a special meeting at any time, or ten per cent of the members may file a request for a special meeting, stating the specific business to be brought before the association, and the meeting shall thereupon be called by the directors. Notice of all meetings, together with a statement of the purposes thereof, shall be mailed to each member at least ten days prior to the meeting, but the by-laws may require that such notice be given by publication in a newspaper. </p>
