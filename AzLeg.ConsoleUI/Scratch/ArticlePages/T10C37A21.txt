<p>A. If the commission determines that one or more grounds exist under section 10-11420 for dissolving a corporation, it shall serve the corporation with written notice of its determination under section 10-3504.</p>

<p>B. If the corporation does not correct each ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the commission that each ground determined by the commission does not exist within sixty days after service of the notice is perfected under section 10-3504, the commission shall administratively dissolve the corporation by signing a certificate of dissolution that recites the ground or grounds for dissolution and its effective date. The commission shall file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the corporation under section 10-3504. If the corporation that has been dissolved is a utility providing domestic water services or domestic wastewater services and the corporation has been dissolved for at least three years, after notice to interested parties, opportunity for objection and hearing before the commission, the assets of the corporation may be transferred by the commission to a domestic water improvement district or a domestic wastewater improvement district established pursuant to title 48, chapter 6 or to a municipality incorporated pursuant to title 9, chapter 1, on receipt by the commission of a written request from the governing body of the district or municipality.</p>

<p>C. Subject to the provisions of section 10-11422 regarding reinstatement, a corporation administratively dissolved continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any activities except those necessary to wind up and liquidate its affairs under section 10-11405 and notify its claimants under sections 10-11406 and 10-11407. If the corporation has not applied for reinstatement within six months after the effective date of the dissolution, the commission shall release the corporate name for use in accordance with chapters 24 through 40 of this title or by a person intending to register the name as a trade name pursuant to title 44, chapter 10, article 3.1.</p>

<p>D. The administrative dissolution of a corporation does not terminate the authority of its statutory agent.</p>
