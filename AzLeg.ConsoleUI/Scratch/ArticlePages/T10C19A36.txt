<p><font color=GREEN>10-2136</font>. <font color=PURPLE><u>Use of roads and streets; notice; protest</u></font></p>

<p>A. A generation and transmission cooperative has the use of, and the right is expressly granted to it to use, the public highways, county highways and streets and alleys in any area of this state. The generation and transmission cooperative may construct and operate lines connecting any points within this state and connect at the state boundary with like lines.</p>

<p>B. Within the confines of municipal corporations, the use and occupancy of streets shall be under such rights as are acquired by franchises according to law and subject to control and regulation by municipal authorities, and the use of public highways, except state highways, by generation and transmission cooperatives not within the confines of an incorporated city or town shall be regulated by the board of supervisors of the county by license or franchise. The board of supervisors in granting the license or franchise, or at any time after it is granted, may impose such restrictions and limitations concerning the use of the public roads as deemed best for the public safety or welfare. Every franchise granted under this section must include provisions requiring the grantee to bear all expenses, including damage and compensation for any alteration of the direction, surface, grade or alignment of any county road, made for the purpose of the franchise.</p>

<p>C. The board of supervisors before granting the privilege contemplated by this section shall give public notice of its intention to make the grant by publishing notice in some newspaper of general circulation, published within the county, for at least once a week for three weeks prior to the day set for the consideration of the action. If, on or before the date, more than fifty per cent of the qualified electors of the county petition the board of supervisors to deny the privilege, they shall so act, and any privilege granted contrary to the petition is void. </p>
