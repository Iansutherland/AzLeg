<p>Except for the provisions of sections 10-2741 and 10-2743, an issuing public corporation may not engage at any time in any business combination or vote, consent or otherwise act to authorize a subsidiary of the issuing public corporation to engage in any business combination with respect to, proposed by or on behalf of or pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether or not in writing, with an interested shareholder of the issuing public corporation or any affiliate or associate of the interested shareholder other than a business combination meeting all the requirements of this chapter, any other applicable section of this title, the articles of incorporation of the issuing public corporation and the requirements specified in any of the following:</p>

<p>1. A business combination, with respect to which the consummation date is no earlier than three years after the interested shareholder's share acquisition date, approved by the board of directors of the issuing public corporation before the interested shareholder's share acquisition date, or as to which the acquisition of shares made by the interested shareholder on the interested shareholder's share acquisition date had been approved by the board of directors of the issuing public corporation before the interested shareholder's share acquisition date.</p>

<p>2. A business combination approved by the affirmative vote of the shareholders holding a majority of the voting power of all shares, excluding shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder proposing the business combination or any affiliate or associate of the interested shareholder proposing the business combination, at a meeting called for that purpose no earlier than three years after the interested shareholder's share acquisition date.</p>

<p>3. A business combination, with respect to which the consummation date is no earlier than three years after the interested shareholder's share acquisition date, that meets all of the following conditions:</p>

<p>(ii) The market value per common share on the announcement date with respect to the business combination or on the interested shareholder's share acquisition date, whichever is higher, plus interest compounded annually from that date through the consummation date at the rate for one year United States treasury obligations from time to time in effect less the aggregate amount of any cash dividends paid, and the market value of any dividends paid other than in cash, per common share since that date, up to the amount of the interest.</p>

<p>(b) The aggregate amount of the cash and the market value as of the consummation date of consideration other than cash to be received per share by holders of outstanding shares of any class or series of stock, other than common shares, of the issuing public corporation in the business combination is at least equal to the highest of the following, whether or not the interested shareholder has previously acquired any stock of the class or series:</p>

<p>(i) The highest per share price paid by the interested shareholder, at a time when the interested shareholder was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of five per cent or more of the voting power of all shares of the issuing public corporation, for any shares of the class or series acquired by it within the three year period immediately before the announcement date with respect to the business combination or within the three year period immediately before, or in, the transaction in which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder, whichever is higher, plus, in either case, interest compounded annually from the earliest date on which the highest per share acquisition price was paid through the consummation date at the rate for one year United States treasury obligations from time to time in effect less the aggregate amount of any cash dividends paid and the market value of any dividends paid other than in cash, per share of the class or series since such earliest date, up to the amount of the interest.</p>

<p>(ii) The highest preferential amount per share to which the holders of stock of the class or series are entitled in the event of any voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the issuing public corporation, plus the aggregate amount of any unpaid dividends declared or due as to which the holders are entitled before payment of dividends on some other class or series of stock, unless the aggregate amount of the dividends is included in the preferential amount.</p>

<p>(iii) The market value per share of the class or series on the announcement date with respect to the business combination or on the interested shareholder's share acquisition date, whichever is higher, plus interest compounded annually from that date through the consummation date at the rate for one year United States treasury obligations from time to time in effect less the aggregate amount of any cash dividends paid and the market value of any dividends paid other than in cash, per share of the class or series since that date, up to the amount of the interest.</p>

<p>(c) The consideration to be received by holders of a particular class or series of outstanding stock, including common shares, of the issuing public corporation in the business combination is in cash or in the same form as the interested shareholder has used to acquire the largest number of shares of the class or series of stock previously acquired by it and the consideration is distributed promptly.</p>

<p>(i) As part of the transaction that resulted in the interested shareholder becoming an interested shareholder.</p>

<p>(ii) By virtue of proportionate share splits, share dividends or other distributions of shares in respect of shares not constituting a business combination.</p>

<p>(iii) Through a business combination meeting all of the conditions of this article.</p>

<p>(iv) Through purchase by the interested shareholder at any price that, if the price had been paid in an otherwise permissible business combination the announcement date and consummation date of which were the date of the purchase, would have satisfied the requirements of subdivisions (a), (b) and (c). </p>
