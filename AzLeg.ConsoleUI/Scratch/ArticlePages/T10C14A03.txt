<p>B. A corporation is dissolved on the effective date of its articles of dissolution.</p>

<p>C. The articles of dissolution shall not be considered complete until the commission has received a notice from the department of revenue to the effect that the tax levied under title 42, chapter 5, article 1 against the corporation has been paid, or until it is notified by the department of revenue that the corporation is not subject to the tax and until the commission has received from the department of revenue its certificate issued pursuant to section 43-1151.</p>

<p>D. Within sixty days after the commission approves the filing, either of the following must occur:</p>

<p>1. A copy of the articles of dissolution shall be published.  An affidavit evidencing the publication may be filed with the commission.</p>

<p>2. The commission shall input the information regarding the approval into the database as prescribed by section 10-130.</p>

<p>E. The articles of dissolution shall not be considered complete until all fees, penalties and costs required to be paid under this title have been paid.</p>
