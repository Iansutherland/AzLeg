<p>An officer is not liable for any action taken as an officer or any failure to take any action if the officer's duties were performed in compliance with section 10-842. In any proceeding commenced under this chapter, an officer has all of the defenses and presumptions ordinarily available to an officer.  An officer is presumed in all cases to have acted, failed to act or otherwise discharged the officer's duties pursuant to section 10-842.  The burden is on the party challenging an officer's action, failure to act or other discharge of duties to establish by clear and convincing evidence facts rebutting the presumptions. </p>
