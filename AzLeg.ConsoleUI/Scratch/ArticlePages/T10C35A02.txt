<p>A. On the terms and conditions and for the consideration determined by the corporation's board of directors, a corporation may sell, lease, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property, with or without the goodwill, other than in the usual and regular course of its activities.</p>

<p>B. For a proposed transaction to be approved, all of the following shall have occurred:</p>

<p>1. The board of directors shall approve the transaction. If the members of the corporation are entitled to vote on the proposed transaction, the board of directors shall submit the proposed transaction for approval by its members and shall recommend the proposed transaction to the members, unless the board of directors determines that because of a conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should not make a recommendation and communicates the basis for its determination to the members with the plan.</p>

<p>2. If the members of the corporation are entitled to vote on the proposed transaction, the members entitled to vote on the proposed transaction shall approve the proposed transaction.</p>

<p>3. Each person whose approval is required by the articles of incorporation for the sale, lease, exchange or other disposal shall approve the proposed transaction in writing.</p>

<p>C. The board of directors may condition its submission of the proposed transaction on any basis.</p>

<p>D. If the corporation submits the transaction for member action at a membership meeting, the corporation shall notify each member to which the proposed transaction is to be submitted for approval of the proposed membership meeting in accordance with section 10-3705. The notice shall state that the purpose or one of the purposes of the meeting is to consider the proposed transaction and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of a description of the transaction.</p>

<p>E. Unless chapters 24 through 40 of this title, the articles of incorporation or the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection C of this section requires a greater vote or voting by class, a majority of the votes cast or a majority of the voting power of the class, whichever is less, shall approve the proposed transaction to be authorized.</p>

<p>F. At any time before consummation of the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of property, the transaction may be abandoned, subject to any contractual rights, without further action by the members or any other person who approved the transaction, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the resolution proposing the transaction or, if none is set forth, in the manner determined by the board of directors.</p>
