<p>1. The shareholders may fill the vacancy.</p>

<p>2. The board of directors may fill the vacancy.</p>

<p>3. If the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the board, they may fill the vacancy by the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the directors remaining in office.</p>

<p>C. A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date by reason of a resignation effective at a later date under section 10-807, subsection B or otherwise may be filled before the vacancy occurs, but the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.</p>
