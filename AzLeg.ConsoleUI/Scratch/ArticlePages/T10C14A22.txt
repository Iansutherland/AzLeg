<p>A. A corporation administratively dissolved under section 10-1421 may apply to the commission for reinstatement within six years after the effective date of dissolution. The application shall both:</p>

<p>1. Recite the name of the corporation and the effective date of its administrative dissolution.</p>

<p>2. State that the ground or grounds for dissolution either did not exist or have been eliminated.</p>

<p>B. If the commission determines that the application contains the information required by subsection A of this section and that the information is correct, it shall cancel the certificate of dissolution and shall prepare a certificate of reinstatement that recites this determination and the effective date of reinstatement, shall file the original of the certificate and shall serve a copy on the corporation under section 10-504.</p>

<p>C. When the reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution and the corporation resumes carrying on its business as if the administrative dissolution had never occurred.</p>

<p>D. If another corporation has adopted the name of the corporation or another person has adopted the name of the corporation as a trade name, the application shall be accompanied by articles of amendment that are in accordance with chapter 10, article 1 of this title and that adopt a new name for the corporation that complies with chapter 4, article 1 of this title.</p>
