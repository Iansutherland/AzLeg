<p>A. A foreign corporation may apply for authority to conduct affairs in this state by delivering an application and a certificate of disclosure to the commission for filing.  The certificate of disclosure shall contain the information set forth in section 10-3202, subsection D and is subject to the requirements of section 10-3202, subsection F.  The application shall be executed by the corporation and shall set forth:</p>

<p>1. The name of the foreign corporation and, if its name is unavailable for use in this state, a corporate name that satisfies the requirements of section 10-11506.</p>

<p>2. The name of the state or country under whose law it is incorporated.</p>

<p>3. Its date of incorporation and period of duration.</p>

<p>4. The street address of its principal office in its state or country of incorporation.</p>

<p>5. The street address of the proposed known place of business of the corporation in this state and the name and street address of its proposed statutory agent in this state.</p>

<p>6. If its purpose or purposes are narrower than the transaction of any or all lawful affairs in which corporations may engage in the state or country under whose law it is incorporated, a statement of the limitations on its purpose.</p>

<p>7. The names and usual business addresses of its current directors and officers.</p>

<p>8. Whether the foreign corporation has members.</p>

<p>9. A brief statement of the character of business that the corporation initially intends actually to conduct in this state. This statement does not limit the character of business that the corporation ultimately conducts.</p>

<p>B. The foreign corporation shall deliver the application and the certificate of disclosure to the commission, together with a copy of its articles of incorporation, any amendments to the articles of incorporation and a certificate of existence or a document of similar import duly authenticated by the secretary of state or other official having custody of corporate records in the state or country under whose law it is incorporated, and the nonrefundable fees required by law.</p>

<p>C. After determining that the application sets forth the information required by this section, does not use as the name of the corporation in this state a name that is in violation of section 10-11506 and appears in all other respects to conform to the requirements of this article, the commission shall file the application.  The date of filing shall be the date on which the corporation is granted authority to transact business in this state.</p>

<p>D. Within sixty days after the commission approves the filing, either of the following must occur:</p>

<p>1. A copy of the application shall be published. An affidavit evidencing the publication may be filed with the commission.</p>

<p>2. The commission shall input the information regarding the approval into the database as prescribed by section 10-130.</p>
