<p>A. A domestic or foreign professional corporation may render professional services in this state only through individuals licensed in this state to render the services.</p>

<p>B. Subsection A of this section does not:</p>

<p>1. Require an individual employed by a professional corporation to be licensed to perform services for the corporation if a license is not otherwise required or prohibit the professional corporation from employing that individual.</p>

<p>2. Prohibit a licensed individual from rendering professional services in an individual capacity although the licensed individual is a shareholder, director, officer, employee or agent of a domestic or foreign professional corporation or any other person or from being a shareholder, director, officer, employee or agent of more than one domestic or foreign professional corporation or other person.</p>

<p>3. Prohibit an individual licensed in another state from rendering professional services for a domestic or foreign professional corporation in this state if not prohibited by the licensing authority.</p>

<p>C. Nothing contained in this chapter alters the right of persons licensed to engage in the rendering of a professional service from rendering a professional service, and those persons may render a professional service, in any other business form or entity, including a corporation incorporated under a general law of this state other than this chapter, unless the use of the form or entity is expressly prohibited by the licensing law of this state applicable to the profession or by the licensing authority with jurisdiction over the profession.</p>

<p>D. This chapter does not apply to any persons in this state who before January 1, 1996 were permitted to render personal services or professional services by means of a corporation other than a professional corporation incorporated under chapter 3, article 1 of this title prior to January 1, 1996 or other business form or entity, or to any corporations other than professional corporations incorporated under chapter 3, article 1 of this title prior to January 1, 1996 or other business forms or entities organized by them unless an exempt corporation or other business form or entity elects professional corporation status pursuant to section 10-2210. </p>
