<p><font color=GREEN>10-1009</font>. <font color=PURPLE><u>Effect of amendments</u></font></p>

<p>An amendment to articles of incorporation does not affect a cause of action existing against or in favor of the corporation, a proceeding to which the corporation is a party or the existing rights of persons other than shareholders of the corporation. An amendment changing a corporation's name does not abate a proceeding brought by or against the corporation in its former name. </p>
