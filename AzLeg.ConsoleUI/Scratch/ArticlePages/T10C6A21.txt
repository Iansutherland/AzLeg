<p><font color=GREEN>10-621</font>. <font color=PURPLE><u>Issuance of shares</u></font></p>

<p>A. The powers granted in this section to the board of directors may be reserved to the shareholders by the articles of incorporation.</p>

<p>B. The board of directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation including cash, services performed or other securities of the corporation, except that neither promissory notes nor future services constitute valid consideration.</p>

<p>C. Before the corporation issues shares, the board of directors must determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate. That determination by the board of directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.</p>

<p>D. When the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued for the consideration are fully paid and nonassessable. </p>
