<p>A. If the commission determines that one or more grounds exist under section 10-1420 for dissolving a corporation, it shall serve the corporation with written notice of its determination under section 10-504.</p>

<p>B. If the corporation does not correct each ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the commission that each ground determined by the commission does not exist within sixty days after service of the notice is perfected under section 10-504, the commission shall administratively dissolve the corporation by signing a certificate of dissolution that recites the ground or grounds for dissolution and its effective date. The commission shall file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the corporation under section 10-504.</p>

<p>C. Subject to the provisions of section 10-1422 regarding reinstatement, a corporation administratively dissolved continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any business except that necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs under section 10-1405 and notify claimants under sections 10-1406 and 10-1407. If the corporation has not applied for reinstatement within six months after the effective date of the dissolution, the commission shall release the corporate name for use in accordance with chapters 1 through 17 of this title or by a person intending to register the name as a trade name pursuant to title 44, chapter 10, article 3.1.</p>

<p>D. The administrative dissolution of a corporation does not terminate the authority of its statutory agent. </p>
