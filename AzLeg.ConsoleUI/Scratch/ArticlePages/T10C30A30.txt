<p>If and to the extent a membership is transferable as provided in section 10-3611, and unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, one or more members may create a voting trust, conferring on one or more trustees the right to vote or otherwise act for them, by signing an agreement setting out the provisions of the trust and transferring their memberships to the trustee or trustees. The agreement may contain any lawful provision not inconsistent with the purposes of the trust. </p>
