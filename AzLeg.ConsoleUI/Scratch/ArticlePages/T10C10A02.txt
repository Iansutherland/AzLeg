<p>2. Delete the names and addresses of the initial directors.</p>

<p>3. Delete the name and address of the initial statutory agent or known place of business, if a statement of change is on file with the commission.</p>

<p>4. Change each issued and unissued authorized share of an outstanding class into a greater number of whole shares if the corporation has only shares of that class outstanding, with all shares of the class being treated identically.</p>

<p>5. Change the corporate name by substituting the word &quot;corporation&quot;, &quot;incorporated&quot;, &quot;company&quot; or &quot;limited&quot; or the abbreviation &quot;corp.&quot;, &quot;inc.&quot;, &quot;co.&quot; or &quot;ltd.&quot; for a similar word or abbreviation in the name or by adding, deleting or changing a geographical attribution for the name.</p>
