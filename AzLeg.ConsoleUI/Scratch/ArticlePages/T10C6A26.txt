<p>A. Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, the board of directors of a corporation may authorize the issuance of some or all of the shares of any or all of its classes or series without certificates.Â  The authorization does not affect shares already represented by certificates until these certificates are surrendered to the corporation.</p>

<p>B. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of shares without certificates, the corporation shall send the shareholder a written statement of the information required on certificates by section 10-625, subsections B and C, and, if applicable, section 10-627. </p>
