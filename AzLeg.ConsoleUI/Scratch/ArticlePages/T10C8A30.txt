<p><font color=GREEN>10-830</font>. <font color=PURPLE><u>General standards of conduct for directors</u></font></p>

<p>A. A director's duties, including duties as a member of a committee, shall be discharged:</p>

<p>1. In good faith.</p>

<p>2. With the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>3. In a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.</p>

<p>B. In discharging duties, a director is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by any of the following:</p>

<p>1. One or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director reasonably believes are reliable and competent in the matters presented.</p>

<p>2. Legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence.</p>

<p>3. A committee of the board of directors of which the director is not a member if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.</p>

<p>C. A director is not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by subsection B of this section unwarranted.</p>

<p>D. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws or a resolution of the board of directors of the corporation, in determining what is in the best interests of the corporation, a director:</p>

<p>1. Must consider the effect of a proposed action or inaction on the shareholders and whether a proposed action or inaction may further the purposes of the corporation.</p>

<p>2. May consider the effects of any action or inaction on the long-term and short-term interests of the corporation, its shareholders, employees, customers, community and environment and any other group and other pertinent factors that the director deems appropriate.</p>

<p>E. The best interests of the corporation do not require that any particular interests be given priority over other interests unless the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, a resolution of the board of directors or a resolution approved by the number of shareholders required to amend the articles of incorporation states an intention to give priority to particular interests. </p>
