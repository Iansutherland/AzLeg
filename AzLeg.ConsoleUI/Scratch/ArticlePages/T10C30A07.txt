<p>A. The bylaws of a corporation may fix or provide the manner of fixing a date as the record date for determining the members entitled to notice of a members' meeting. If the bylaws do not fix or provide for fixing that record date, the board may fix a future date as that record date. If that record date is not fixed, members at the close of business on the business day before the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day before the day on which the meeting is held, are entitled to notice of the meeting.</p>

<p>B. The bylaws of a corporation may fix or provide the manner of fixing a date as the record date for determining the members entitled to vote at a members' meeting. If the bylaws do not fix or provide for fixing that record date, the board may fix a future date as that record date. If that record date is not fixed, members on the date of the meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the meeting.</p>

<p>C. The bylaws may fix or provide the manner for determining a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action. If the bylaws do not fix or provide for fixing that record date, the board may fix in advance that record date. If that record date is not fixed, members at the close of business on the day on which the board adopts the resolution relating to that record date, or the sixtieth day before the date of other action, whichever is later, are entitled to exercise those rights.</p>

<p>D. The record date fixed under this section shall not be more than seventy days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of members.</p>

<p>E. A determination of members entitled to notice of or to vote at a membership meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting, unless the board fixed a new date for determining the right to notice or the right to vote. The board shall fix a new date for determining the right to notice or the right to vote if the meeting is adjourned to a date that is more than seventy days after the record date for determining members entitled to notice of the original meeting.</p>

<p>F. If a court orders a meeting adjourned to another date, the original record date for notice of voting continues in effect. </p>
