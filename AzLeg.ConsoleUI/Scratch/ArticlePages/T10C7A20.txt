<p><font color=GREEN>10-720</font>. <font color=PURPLE><u>Shareholders' list for meeting</u></font></p>

<p>A. After fixing a record date for a meeting, a corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all of its shareholders who are entitled to notice of a shareholders' meeting. The list shall be arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or series of shares, and shall show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder.</p>

<p>B. The shareholders' list shall be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation's principal office, the office of the corporation's transfer agent if specified in the meeting notice or at another place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A shareholder, its agent or its attorney on written demand may inspect and, subject to the requirements of section 10-1602, subsection C, may copy the list, during regular business hours and at his expense, during the period it is available for inspection.</p>

<p>C. The corporation shall make the shareholders' list available at the meeting, and any shareholder, its agent or its attorney may inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.</p>

<p>D. If the corporation refuses to allow a shareholder, its agent or its attorney to inspect the shareholders' list before or at the meeting or copy the list as permitted by subsection B of this section, the court in the county where a corporation's principal office, or, if none in this state, its known place of business, is located, on application of the shareholder, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the corporation's expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete.</p>

<p>E. Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the shareholders' list does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting. </p>
