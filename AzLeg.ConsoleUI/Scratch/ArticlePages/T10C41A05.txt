<p><font color=GREEN>10-11805.</font> <font color=PURPLE><u>Release or modification of restrictions on management, investment or purpose</u></font></p>

<p>A. If the donor consents in a record, an institution may release or modify, in whole or in part, a restriction contained in a gift instrument on the management, investment or purpose of an institutional fund.  A release or modification may not allow a fund to be used for a purpose other than a charitable purpose of the institution. </p>

<p>B. On application of an institution, the court may modify a restriction contained in a gift instrument regarding the management or investment of an institutional fund if the restriction has become impracticable or wasteful, if it impairs the management or investment of the fund or if, because of circumstances not anticipated by the donor, a modification of a restriction will further the purposes of the fund.  The institution shall notify the attorney general of the application, and the attorney general shall be given an opportunity to be heard.  To the extent practicable, any modification shall be made in accordance with the donor's probable intention.</p>

<p>C. If a particular charitable purpose or a restriction contained in a gift instrument on the use of an institutional fund becomes unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve or wasteful, on application of an institution, the court may modify the purpose of the fund or the restriction on the use of the fund in a manner consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument.  The institution shall notify the attorney general of the application, and the attorney general shall be given an opportunity to be heard.  </p>

<p>D. If an institution determines that a restriction contained in a gift instrument on the management, investment or purpose of an institutional fund is unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve or wasteful, the institution, after sixty days after notification to the attorney general, may release or modify the restriction, in whole or part, if all of the following apply:</p>

<p>1. The institutional fund subject to the restriction has a total value of less than fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>2. More than twenty years have elapsed since the fund was established.</p>

<p>3. The institution uses the property in a manner consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument. </p>
