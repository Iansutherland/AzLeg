<p>If a member of an association established without capital stock has paid his membership fee, he may receive a certificate of membership. Members are not liable for debts of the association above the sum remaining unpaid on their membership fees. No member is entitled to more than one vote unless the bylaws provide otherwise. In no event is a member allowed to have more than five votes which are based on actual patronage, and a member is not allowed more than one vote because of the amount of membership capital he may own. </p>
