<p><font color=GREEN>10-852</font>. <font color=PURPLE><u>Mandatory indemnification</u></font></p>

<p>A. Unless limited by its articles of incorporation, a corporation shall indemnify a director who was the prevailing party, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which the director was a party because the director is or was a director of the corporation against reasonable expenses incurred by the director in connection with the proceeding.</p>

<p>B. Unless limited by its articles of incorporation, section 10-851, subsection D or subsection C of this section, a corporation shall indemnify an outside director against liability. Unless limited by its articles of incorporation or subsection C of this section, a corporation shall pay an outside director's expenses in advance of a final disposition of a proceeding, if the director furnishes the corporation with a written affirmation of the director's good faith belief that the director has met the standard of conduct described in section 10-851, subsection A and the director furnishes the corporation with a written undertaking executed personally, or on the director's behalf, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that the director did not meet the standard of conduct. The undertaking required by this subsection is an unlimited general obligation of the director but need not be secured and shall be accepted without reference to the director's financial ability to make repayment.</p>

<p>C. A corporation shall not provide the indemnification or advancement of expenses described in subsection B of this section if a court of competent jurisdiction has determined before payment that the outside director failed to meet the standards described in section 10-851, subsection A, and a court of competent jurisdiction does not otherwise authorize payment under section 10-854. A corporation shall not delay payment of indemnification or expenses under subsection B of this section for more than sixty days after a request is made unless ordered to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction. </p>
