<p><font color=GREEN>10-2401.</font> <font color=PURPLE><u>Application and effect of chapter</u></font></p>

<p>A. This chapter is applicable to all benefit corporations.</p>

<p>B. The existence of a provision of this chapter does not of itself create an implication that a contrary or different rule of law is applicable to a business corporation that is not a benefit corporation. This chapter does not affect a statute or rule of law that is applicable to a business corporation that is not a benefit corporation.</p>

<p>C. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 of this title are generally applicable to all benefit corporations.  The specific provisions of this chapter control over the general provisions of chapters 1 through 17 of this title.</p>

<p>D. A benefit corporation may be subject simultaneously to this chapter and chapter 18 or 20 of this title.  In that event, the provisions of this chapter control over chapter 18 or 20.</p>

<p>E. A provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a benefit corporation may not limit, be inconsistent with or supersede a provision of this chapter.</p>

<p>F. The enumeration in this chapter of powers and interests of a benefit corporation does not imply that the powers and interests do not exist in or may not be considered by any other type of corporation, and unless provided otherwise in the articles of incorporation or bylaws or a resolution of the board of directors, any corporation formed under this title has the powers of a benefit corporation under this chapter and a director of any corporation formed under this title may consider any interests that may be considered by a director of a benefit corporation under this chapter in determining what is in the best interests of the corporation. </p>
