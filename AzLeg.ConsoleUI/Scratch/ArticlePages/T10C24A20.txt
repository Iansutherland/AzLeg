The person shall retain the original document for at least twelve months in the books and records of the corporation or of the person making the delivery for filing, if the delivery is not made on behalf of the corporation, and the person shall make the original documents available for inspection and copying by the commission on reasonable notice.</p>

<p>2. A document that is reproduced at a fax machine or through an electronic transmission at the commission is deemed delivered to the commission:</p>
