<p>The commission may propound to any domestic or foreign corporation subject to chapters 24 through 40 of this title and to any officer or director of the corporation interrogatories as may be reasonably necessary and proper to enable it to ascertain whether the corporation complied with all of the provisions of chapters 24 through 40 of this title applicable to the corporation. The interrogatories shall be answered within thirty days after the mailing of the interrogatories or within an additional time fixed by the commission, and the answers to the interrogatories shall be full and complete and shall be made in writing and under oath. If the interrogatories are directed to an individual they shall be answered by the individual, and if directed to a corporation they shall be answered by the president, vice-president, secretary or assistant secretary of the corporation. The commission need not file any document to which the interrogatories relate until the interrogatories have been answered as provided in this section, and not then if the answers to the interrogatories disclose that the document is not in conformity with the provisions of chapters 24 through 40 of this title. The commission shall certify to the attorney general, for such action as the attorney general deems appropriate, all interrogatories and answers to the interrogatories that disclose a violation of any of the provisions of chapters 24 through 40 of this title. </p>
