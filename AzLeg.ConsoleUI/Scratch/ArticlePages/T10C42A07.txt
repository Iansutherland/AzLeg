<p>In case of the death, resignation or removal of a person who, at the time of his death, resignation or removal, was holding the title to property for the use or benefit of any church or religious society not incorporated as a corporation sole, the title to such property held by him shall not revert to the donor, nor vest in the heirs of the deceased person, but shall be deemed to be in abeyance after the death, resignation or removal until his successor is duly appointed to fill the vacancy. Upon appointment of a successor, the title to all property held by his predecessor shall at once, without any other act or deed, vest in the person appointed to fill the vacancy. </p>
